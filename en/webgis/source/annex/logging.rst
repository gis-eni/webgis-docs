Application Logging (Console / OpenTelemetry / Serilog / Seq)
================================================================

.. note::

   This page describes the **application/host logging** layer only - i.e. where the
   standard ``Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`` events produced by ASP.NET Core itself and by the
   WebGIS internals end up. It is independent of the **GeoService performance/exception
   logging** switch (``Api:logging-type``) described in :doc:`../config/api/index`, which writes
   dedicated ``webgis_performance``/``webgis_exceptions`` records rather than generic
   application log events - the two layers can end up pointed at the same database server, just
   at different tables.

The ``Api``, ``Cms`` and ``Portal`` hosts all share the same setup, so everything below applies
to all three (adjust the file names accordingly, e.g. ``Cms/appsettings.json``).

.. important::

   ``MicrosoftGeoServiceRequestLogger`` (the ``microsoft`` ``IGeoServiceRequestLogger``, i.e. the
   per-request "audit" log, as opposed to the performance timings) logs at ``LogLevel.Trace`` -
   the most verbose level, disabled by default. ``Logging:LogLevel:Default`` is normally
   ``Information``, so nothing is written for this category unless it is explicitly overridden
   (raising only ``Default`` is **not** enough, since ``Trace`` is more verbose than
   ``Information``):

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "Logging": {
          "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Information",
            "Api.Core.AppCode.Services.Logging.MicrosoftGeoServiceRequestLogger": "Trace"
          }
        }
      }

   This can go into ``appsettings.json``, ``_config/logging.json`` (see below), or as the
   environment variable
   ``Logging__LogLevel__Api.Core.AppCode.Services.Logging.MicrosoftGeoServiceRequestLogger=Trace``.
   If a specific provider (e.g. ``Console``) has its own narrower ``Logging:<Provider>:LogLevel``
   section, that provider needs the same override too.

   Under the hood, WebGIS always routes logging through Serilog, which normally only obeys its
   own ``Serilog:MinimumLevel`` section and ignores ``Logging:LogLevel`` entirely; WebGIS bridges
   ``Logging:LogLevel`` into Serilog's ``MinimumLevel`` automatically, so this standard ASP.NET
   Core section keeps working as documented. An explicit ``Serilog:MinimumLevel``/``Override``
   entry for the same category always takes precedence over the bridged ``Logging:LogLevel``
   value.

Configuring via ``_config`` (recommended for production/Kubernetes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Most customers only touch the ``_config`` directory next to the application binaries (it also
holds ``api.config``/``cms.config``/``portal.config``) - in a Kubernetes deployment this is
typically the one directory mounted from a ConfigMap/Secret volume, while ``appsettings.json``
and the pod's environment variables are not (easily) editable per instance. Everything on this
page can therefore also be configured by dropping one or both of these optional files into
``_config``, with no rebuild and no pod-spec changes required:

- **``_config/logging.json``** - a regular JSON file merged into the standard configuration,
  i.e. anything that could otherwise only be configured via ``appsettings.json`` or environment
  variables (``Logging``, ``Serilog``, ``OTEL_*`` keys, ...) can be placed here instead. All JSON
  examples on this page work unchanged as the content of ``_config/logging.json``.
- **``_config/logging.env``** - a simple ``KEY=VALUE`` per line file (like a Docker
  ``--env-file``, ``#`` starts a comment line), loaded as real process environment variables
  before the app starts. Useful for the standard OpenTelemetry ``OTEL_*`` variables shown below,
  since they are normally set as environment variables rather than nested JSON. An environment
  variable that is already set on the process/pod always wins over the file.

Example ``_config/logging.env``:

.. code-block:: text

   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc

Both files are optional and take effect for ``Api``, ``Cms`` and ``Portal`` alike; a missing
file is a no-op. ``_config/logging.json`` is loaded after ``appsettings.json``/
``appsettings.<Environment>.json``, so it overrides them (matching how ``_config/*.config``
already overrides other defaults today).

Console (default)
------------------

Out of the box, logs go to the console (stdout), formatted as plain text - this is the ASP.NET
Core default and requires no configuration. Log levels are controlled the usual way via the
``Logging:LogLevel`` section in ``appsettings.json`` or environment variables
(``Logging__LogLevel__Default=Information``, ...).

For structured/JSON console output (useful when a container log collector like
Filebeat/Fluent Bit/Promtail parses stdout), switch the console formatter:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Logging": {
       "Console": {
         "FormatterName": "json"
       }
     }
   }

OpenTelemetry (OTLP) - recommended for most backends
-------------------------------------------------------

The ``Api``, ``Cms`` and ``Portal`` hosts export logs, metrics and traces via the OpenTelemetry
Protocol (OTLP) whenever an OTLP endpoint is configured. This is controlled purely by the
standard OpenTelemetry environment variables - no other configuration or rebuild is needed:

.. code-block:: text

   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc        # or "http/protobuf" for port 4318
   OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=webgis-api            # optional, defaults to the host name

If ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` is not set, no OTLP exporter is created and there is no
overhead.

These can be set as regular process/pod environment variables, or - if only the ``_config``
directory is available - via ``_config/logging.env`` (see above).

This is the lowest-effort way to plug WebGIS into most modern observability backends, because
they all speak OTLP natively (no WebGIS-specific sink needed): an OpenTelemetry Collector (which
can then fan out anywhere), Grafana stack (Loki/Tempo/Mimir), Elastic (8.x+ / Elastic Cloud),
Seq, Jaeger, Zipkin, Honeycomb, Datadog, New Relic, Azure Monitor, AWS X-Ray/ADOT, etc.

.. note::

   Previously this was only wired up for local development (.NET Aspire). It is now available in
   release builds of ``Api``, ``Cms`` and ``Portal`` as well.

Request log entries on the trace
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GeoService requests (``GetMap``, ``GetSelection``, ..., print jobs) each run inside their own
``geoservice:{command} {service}`` trace span (``WebGIS.GeoServices`` ``ActivitySource``, tagged
with ``webgis.category``/``command``/``server``/``service``/``map``/``success``). While that span
is active, every ``IGeoServiceRequestLogger.LogString(...)`` call (the per-request "audit" trail
- e.g. the underlying HTTP request/response to the real GIS server) is also attached to it as an
OpenTelemetry span event (``webgis.geoservice.request``, with ``webgis.server``/``service``/
``command`` tags). In a trace viewer (e.g. the Aspire dashboard's trace detail view, or the "View
Logs" action there for the correlated log entries), this means the request-audit trail for a
call shows up directly next to/on its span, not just as a separately-filtered log level.
Recording the span event does not depend on the ``microsoft`` ``IGeoServiceRequestLogger``'s own
``LogLevel.Trace`` setting (see above) - it is skipped only when nothing is sampling/listening to
the trace.

The request and response are kept as two separate tags instead of being concatenated into one
string:

- ``webgis.requestResult`` - the response (or, for call sites that only log a single value, that
  value) - typically JSON, and still recognizable as such by tooling since nothing is prefixed in
  front of it.
- ``webgis.requestBody`` - only present when a request body was actually logged separately (e.g.
  the outgoing request sent to the upstream GIS server).

The same split applies to the structured log entry itself: with a request body, the request
logger logs ``requestBody`` and ``message`` as distinct named placeholders (rather than one
pre-joined string), so a JSON response is still parsed as JSON by log backends that recognize
structured fields.

Serilog sinks (SQL Server / PostgreSQL / Seq)
-------------------------------------------------

For deployments that need logs written directly into a relational database - without standing
up an OpenTelemetry Collector - ``Api``, ``Cms`` and ``Portal`` additionally run
`Serilog <https://serilog.net/>`_ alongside the default logging pipeline, so it augments rather
than replaces OTLP/console logging. Serilog is purely config-driven: with no ``Serilog`` section
present, nothing changes from the default behavior (console output only).

To add a sink, add a ``Serilog`` section to ``appsettings.json`` (or
``appsettings.Production.json``, or environment variables) - or, equivalently, to
``_config/logging.json`` (see above).

SQL Server
++++++++++

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "LogsDb": "Server=sql-host;Database=WebGisLogs;User Id=webgis;Password=***;TrustServerCertificate=True"
     },
     "Serilog": {
       "WriteTo": [
         {
           "Name": "MSSqlServer",
           "Args": {
             "connectionString": "LogsDb",
             "sinkOptions": {
               "tableName": "Logs",
               "autoCreateSqlTable": true
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }

PostgreSQL
++++++++++

The PostgreSQL sink needs its configuration companion package to be loaded explicitly via
``Using``, and - unlike ``MSSqlServer``, which ships sensible default columns - it has **no**
built-in defaults: a ``Columns`` section describing which columns to write and how must always
be supplied. Omitting it fails fast at startup with:

.. code-block:: text

   System.InvalidOperationException: 'Columns' section not found in provided configuration path:

The ``Columns`` section must be a **root-level** key of the configuration - a sibling of
``Serilog``/``ConnectionStrings``, *not* nested inside ``Serilog`` (it is easy to assume
otherwise, since everything else Serilog-related lives under the ``Serilog`` section). If it
needs to be placed elsewhere (e.g. to avoid a name clash), point at it explicitly via
``Serilog:WriteTo:Args:configurationPath``.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "LogsDb": "Host=pg-host;Port=5432;Database=webgis_logs;Username=webgis;Password=***"
     },
     "Serilog": {
       "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.PostgreSQL.Configuration" ],
       "WriteTo": [
         {
           "Name": "PostgreSQL",
           "Args": {
             "connectionString": "LogsDb",
             "tableName": "logs",
             "needAutoCreateTable": true
           }
         }
       ]
     },
     "Columns": {
       "message": "RenderedMessageColumnWriter",
       "message_template": "MessageTemplateColumnWriter",
       "level": {
         "Name": "LevelColumnWriter",
         "Args": { "renderAsText": true, "dbType": "Varchar" }
       },
       "raise_date": "TimestampColumnWriter",
       "exception": "ExceptionColumnWriter",
       "properties": "LogEventSerializedColumnWriter"
     }
   }

Both sinks are batching sinks (periodic bulk insert), so they have negligible impact on request
latency.

Seq
+++

Unlike the DB sinks above, `Seq <https://datalust.co/seq>`__ is not a relational database - it is
a small, self-hostable log server with its own storage engine and UI (see
`Setting up Seq`_ below for how to run it). The sink just needs a URL and (optionally) an API
key - no table/columns to define:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Serilog": {
       "WriteTo": [
         {
           "Name": "Seq",
           "Args": {
             "serverUrl": "http://seq-host:5341",
             "apiKey": "***"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }

This, too, is a batching sink with negligible latency impact, and can run alongside the SQL
Server/PostgreSQL sink (e.g. DB for long-term retention, Seq for day-to-day search) - Serilog
happily writes to any number of configured sinks at once.

Oracle
++++++

There is currently no well-maintained Serilog sink for Oracle, so a direct DB sink is not
offered for Oracle. If the log backend is Oracle-only, use the OTLP path instead (e.g. an
OpenTelemetry Collector with an Oracle/JDBC exporter, or export to an OTLP-native backend and
query it there).

Viewing & analyzing logs
---------------------------

Which tool makes sense depends on which sink(s) are enabled:

- **Only the SQL Server/PostgreSQL sink, ad-hoc troubleshooting**: a regular DB client is
  enough - no extra tool needed. Azure Data Studio/SSMS (SQL Server) or pgAdmin/DBeaver
  (PostgreSQL). The structured ``Properties``/``properties`` column is JSON
  (``NVARCHAR``/``jsonb``), queryable directly, e.g.:

  .. code-block:: sql

     -- SQL Server
     SELECT TOP 100 * FROM Logs
     WHERE Level = 'Warning' AND JSON_VALUE(Properties, '$.RequestPath') LIKE '%GetMap%'
     ORDER BY TimeStamp DESC;

     -- PostgreSQL
     SELECT * FROM logs
     WHERE level = 'Warning' AND properties->>'RequestPath' LIKE '%GetMap%'
     ORDER BY raise_date DESC LIMIT 100;

  This does not give full-text search, dashboards, alerting, or trace correlation though - it is
  fine for "quick lookup", not for ongoing analysis.

- **Dashboards/alerting/search - recommended: Grafana** (OSS, self-hostable, free). It can be
  pointed at what is already configured, with no need to add another sink:

  - Directly at the **SQL Server/PostgreSQL sink table** via Grafana's built-in SQL data
    sources - dashboards/alerts on top of data already being written today.
  - At the **OTLP path** via Loki (logs) + Tempo (traces) + Prometheus/Mimir (metrics) - the
    de-facto open source stack for OpenTelemetry, and a natural fit since ``Api``/``Cms``/
    ``Portal`` already export OTLP once ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` is set (see above). This
    also enables trace/log/metric correlation (e.g. drilling from a slow ``GetMap`` trace into
    its log lines), which the DB sinks alone cannot provide.

- **Simplest "just show me the logs" option, no Grafana setup**: `Seq <https://datalust.co/seq>`__
  - single Docker container, understands Serilog's structured events natively, free for a single
  user/small team, and accepts OTLP directly too (see below for step-by-step setup).

- **Customer already runs a cloud/enterprise observability platform**: point
  ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` at it - Azure Monitor/Application Insights, AWS CloudWatch,
  Elastic/OpenSearch + Kibana, Datadog, New Relic, ... all accept OTLP natively (directly or via
  an OpenTelemetry Collector), no code changes required.

Setting up Seq
++++++++++++++++

Unlike Grafana, Seq has no "SQL data source" concept - it can only show events that were sent to
it directly, either via OTLP or as a Serilog sink. It **cannot** simply be pointed at an
already-populated ``Logs``/``logs`` table in SQL Server/PostgreSQL and browse that in place; if
that is the goal (view/analyze what the DB sink already collects, without touching anything
else), use Grafana's built-in SQL data source against that table instead (see above) - no
dual-write, no extra sink required.

If Seq's own UI/search is still preferred, WebGIS needs to additionally send events to Seq -
either as the `Seq`_ sink documented above (dual-write, alongside the existing SQL
Server/PostgreSQL sink if any), or via OTLP as described below - both are already fully wired up.

No WebGIS-specific sink/package is needed for the OTLP route below - Seq
`natively implements OTLP ingestion <https://docs.datalust.co/docs/ingestion-with-opentelemetry>`_,
so that path is purely a matter of pointing the existing OTLP exporter at it.

1. Run Seq (persists its data in ``<local path>``, replace ``<password>`` with the initial admin
   password):

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run --name seq -d --restart unless-stopped \
        -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y \
        -e SEQ_FIRSTRUN_ADMINPASSWORD=<password> \
        -v <local path>:/data \
        -p 5341:80 \
        datalust/seq

2. In the Seq UI (``http://<seq-host>:5341``), create a dedicated API key per app under
   *Settings > API Keys* (recommended, not required) - this makes it easy to tell
   ``Api``/``Cms``/``Portal`` traffic apart later in *Data > Ingestion*.

3. Point WebGIS's OTLP exporter at Seq's OTLP endpoint - either as real environment variables,
   or via ``_config/logging.env`` (see above):

   .. code-block:: text

      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://<seq-host>:5341/ingest/otlp
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=X-Seq-ApiKey=<api-key-from-step-2>

   Note the endpoint is Seq's ingestion path (``/ingest/otlp``), not just the host root - the
   exporter appends ``/v1/logs``/``/v1/traces`` itself. ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`` can be
   omitted if no API key was created in step 2.

   Alternatively - no traces, but structured events with full property fidelity and less config
   - add the `Seq`_ sink to ``_config/logging.json`` instead, using the same URL/API key.

4. Restart ``Api``/``Cms``/``Portal`` (environment variables are only read at process startup, so
   ``_config/logging.env`` changes need a restart, unlike ``_config/logging.json`` which is
   picked up automatically). Logs and traces (including the GeoService request/performance spans
   described above) start showing up in the Seq UI immediately - with full trace/span correlation
   via the *Trace* menu on each event.

The SQL Server/PostgreSQL sink can keep running in parallel if it is already configured (e.g.
for long-term retention/compliance) - Seq is simply an additional, independent consumer of the
same telemetry.

Notes
-----

- Everything on this page (Serilog sinks, OTLP, Seq, Grafana, ...) concerns *where application
  log events go*; it is independent of the ``Api:logging-type`` GeoService performance/exception
  logging switch described in :doc:`../config/api/index`, which - since it now also supports
  ``sqlserver``/``postgres``/``sqlite``/``oracle`` - can end up pointed at the same database
  server, just a different, purpose-built ``webgis_performance``/``webgis_exceptions`` table
  rather than the generic ``Logs`` table the Serilog DB sinks write to.
- Multiple sinks can be active at once (e.g. console + OTLP + SQL Server) - enable only what is
  needed.
